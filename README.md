# Activity_Simulator
A program developed with the purpose of simulating the activities of a person living in a smart house. The program gets activity data from
a database and simulates it in a graphical simulator.

The program was developed as part of a master's thesis in collaboration with the SMART research group at the University of Southeast Norway.
